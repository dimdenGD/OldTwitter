# OldTwitter (2024)
Browser extension to return old Twitter layout from 2015 (and option to use 2018 design).

## FAQ

#### Can you use this extension on Android?

Yes, you can use Kiwi Browser to install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-twitter-layout-2022/jgejdcdoeeabklepnkdbglgccjpdgpmf) or Firefox Beta/Nightly to install it from [Addons For Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-twitter-layout-2022/) ([follow these steps for Firefox](https://www.androidpolice.com/install-add-on-extension-mozilla-firefox-android/)). Once installed you can press on "Add to Home screen" button in Kiwi Browser to have it as standalone app.

#### Is this extension safe?

[The source code is available at GitHub](https://github.com/dimdenGD/OldTwitter) so you can check everything yourself. It never sends any of your personal info anywhere.

#### [insert thing] doesn't look like it was in 2015 Twitter!

Extension won't be pixel perfect copy of old Twitter. I just took general look and feel of it.

You had algorithmical timeline enabled. By default OldTwitter turns on reverse chronological timeline, you can switch it back to algorithmical timeline in settings or using the switch on the right side.

#### How do I visit original Twitter client after installing extension?

You need to add `?newtwitter=true` to end of your current URL. There's also a "Open this page in new Twitter" button on all pages on bottom right.

#### Where are the extension settings?

Click on your profile picture on top-right and then Settings button.

#### I don't like 2015 design, can I have something more modern

There's a setting to use design from 2018.
