# OldTwitter (2023)
Browser extension to return old Twitter layout from 2015.

## FAQ
#### Can you use this extension on Android?
Yes, you can use Kiwi Browser to install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-twitter-layout-2022/jgejdcdoeeabklepnkdbglgccjpdgpmf) or Firefox Nightly to install it from [Addons For Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-twitter-layout-2022/) ([follow these steps for Firefox](https://www.androidpolice.com/install-add-on-extension-mozilla-firefox-android/)).  
  
#### Is this extension safe?
The code is open source so you can check everything yourself. It never sends any of your personal info anywhere.  

#### [insert thing] doesn't look like it was in 2015 Twitter!
Extension won't be pixel perfect copy of old Twitter. I just took general look and feel of it.

#### I installed extension and my timeline is feels kinda unusual
You had algorithmical timeline enabled. By default OldTwitter turns on reverse chronological timeline. If you really want algo timeline back go to [extension settings](https://twitter.com/old/settings).  

#### How do I visit original Twitter client after installing extension?
You need to add `?newtwitter=true` to end of your current URL. There's also a "Open this page in new Twitter" button on all pages on bottom right.
